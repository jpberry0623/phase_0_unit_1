## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I do enjoy writing in general, whether it's a blog or a birthday card.  I type these reflections quickly so I do not try and make them works of art in terms of literary styling, but I studied literature at University and reading and writing are two things I enjoy wholeheartedly.  Writing comes easy to me, although I'm not the most articulate and I try to get these reflections down quickly so the content is fresh in my mind.  But I must admit I cannot allocate a huge amount of time to writing while trying to juggle my job and Phase_0. So as long as people eading my reflections and challenges don't mind typos, I should be good to go.
