Wireframing was a good exercise for me.  I have a bad habit of rushing into my code -- the try, fail, revise technique.  Learning about design, UI/UX, and wireframing helped me to understand the concepts of design and in order to appropriately design a site for you user you need to step back and understand the user and the goals of the site.  I usually just jump into a text editor and start coding, but taking time to wireframe a site and think about the design aspect and user interface prior to writing any code really was beneficial to my understanding of the process. It was also helpful to stop and think about sites I enjoy using and think about why I enjoy that UX.

I used a nifty tool for my wireframes called balsamiq which another boot had posted on the google + community. It was easy to use and made wireframing a straightforward process.  It would have been quicker using the old pen to paper method, but I think its a good idea to get into the habit of trying out new apps as often as possible. Although I do not enjoy wireframing as much as the hands on coding, this challenge really has helped me understand the importance of considering the aspects of your site before you write any code. This is something I think is beneficial to the final product and success in terms of UI/UX.  It also will cut down on writing unnessecary code and wasting man hours on a project.  Getting a solid foundation first in your wireframe puts you on a good path for the overall design you seek, rather than bumbling around in a text editor constantly writing and erasing code.
