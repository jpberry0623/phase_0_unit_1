## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a repository is very easy in Guthub.  First, log into Github and simply click "new repository" in the bottom right, then name the new repository with an optional description, choose whether it is to be a puiblic or private file, then add a license to it and click "create repository".  You can also create a new repository from your command line locally on your computer.  To this you simply change directories to the folder you want the git file to appear in, then type "git init" followed by "git add" filename. 

Open source is a facinating concept to me. Open source software is something that is available to everyone to use, but it can be modified, changed and redistributed by others.  It has so many avdantages because many people can bring a variety of ideas to a problem that would have traditional only be solved by a small group of individuals.  Also the ability to modify software to your group/companys specific needs makes sense.The idea sounds great and I understand the benefits of open source, but I must admit as someone who has studied business and economics, it sounds counter-intuitive to the business world and turning a profit.

I had to do some extra studying when it comes to licensing.  Trying to understand exactly what part of your code is proprietary vs what is out of your hands once it goes public. it did lead me to research a bit on GPL, BDS, EULA. I think licensing your projects is important, but why share a project with the world if licensing the idea is your first concern?
