* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML and CSS make the most sense to me of any language Ive looked at thus far.  The text is plain and the rules for tags are simple and easy to follow. HTML follows a logical formation to figure out because the elements are named for what they do. I really enjoy the front end user interface design work in html and css and I am excited to learn more about it and move forward in learning how to effiviently and effectively design a webpage.


It may be because I am a novice, but there does seems to be significant repetion in HTML in terms of various divs for each elelemt, classes within divs and so forth.  When studying ruby I always read something about the "DRY" concept, so I guess the same goes for HTML and CSS and as I practice it I will learn how to write cleaner concise code. 

I did have some Aha moments when playing around with drop down menus.  It took me awhile to figure out how to nest the links within the list item above and to get the position and margins right so it did what I wanted. I find youtube is my best friend when it comes to learning HTML and CSS.  Watching someone else code from the groud up in a text editor really helps me see how they plan the look/feel they want in the page and attack each seperate div or class to get the right result. i have used 'Gaute Michel Ferstad' youtube videos and the video that helped me quite a bit with my drop down concept was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmQm-p3wCSU.
