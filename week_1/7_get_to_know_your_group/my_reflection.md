## 7. [Getting to know your group](7_get_to_know_your_group/readme.md)

1. Copy your response to <a href="https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_unit_1/tree/master/week_1/6_Get_to_know_your_group" target="_blank"> Get to know your group</a> in this file.

I have not recieved a reflection fro anyone in my accountability group yet, but I can come back and revise this reflection once they are sent.  I reflected on my own feelings below.

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 


I have a healthy dose of fear when it comes to Dev Bootcamp.  Not only am I quitting my job, but I'm diving head first into an unknown world where I have not idea how well I will stack up.  I think that is part of what makes this process so exciting for me, everything from here out with be totally unknown until I do it.  Its scary, but liberating at the same time.  This week has made me feel good about my decision to enroll at DBC, but I think the claim of 10-15 hours per week is not accurate at all.  I;ve spent at least 25 hours on this material and could happily do it full time if I wasn't working ( should I still be working?)  This week has eased my fears a little, only because we have gotten started and things seem better once your in the middle of them and getting stuff done, not because it is less work than I thought or the material is easier.  I wish I had more time for learning and reflecting, but I'm having fun so that's a good sign.
