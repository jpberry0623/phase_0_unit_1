## 7. [Getting to know your group](7_get_to_know_your_group/readme.md)

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. My Name is John Berry. I live at the Jersey Shore and have been working oin the financial industry since college and am working at a non-profit teaching financial education currently.  I'm super excited about this life changing opportunity and to share the journey with all of you.  In my free time I like to brew beer, surf, golf, cook, and read just to name a few.  I'm generally a nice, laid back guy.

Reading through others reflections and talking with the group its good to know we are all about the same level -- very little.  It make me feel better knowing others are struggling and getting stuck in similar areas that I have.  I think a big part of this experience is that we are all going to be there to help one another out.  And knowing that we will have each others backs will hopefully make some of our frustrations more bearable.

Time management will be tough for me as I am continuing to work full time through phase_0.  I have already felt a lot of pressure regarding keeping a pace to get my exercise done and comprehended and I feel like it could be easy to fall behind if work gets really busy.  I might consider leaving earlier than anticipated if I absolutely have to.  In the end I need to allocate at least 2-3 hours a night for these units.  Ideally my goal will be to have most of the parts complete by friday night so I can spend the weekend going back over rough spots for complete comprehension and understanding. 

Plan : 2-3 hours a night - toally focused, review and complete on the weekend.  Pairing when I can fit it in along with office hours if I have a rough sticking point in the curriculum. I need to not hesitate to ask questions and seek assitance when I know I need it.  I also what to keep refreshing on Ruby as wee move through the other topics so that information can stay in my head.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 


I have a healthy dose of fear when it comes to Dev Bootcamp and its good to know others are sharing the same feelings.  Not only am I quitting my job, but I'm diving head first into an unknown world where I have not idea how well I will stack up.  I think that is part of what makes this process so exciting for me, everything from here out with be totally unknown until I do it.  Its scary, but liberating at the same time.  This week has made me feel good about my decision to enroll at DBC, but I think the claim of 10-15 hours per week is not accurate at all.  I've spent at least 25 hours on this material and could happily do it full time if I wasn't working ( should I still be working?)  This week has eased my fears a little, only because we have gotten started and things seem better once your in the middle of them and getting stuff done, not because it is less work than I thought or the material is easier.  I wish I had more time for learning and reflecting, but I'm having fun so that's a good sign.
