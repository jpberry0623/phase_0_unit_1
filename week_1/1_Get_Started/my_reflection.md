## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?


Setting up Git was fairly straightforward, only due to the amount of direction we were given on the install instructions.  If not for those I would have been a little lost.  Learning the command line has been very interesting, but somewhat difficult at the same time.  Coming from a GUI environment to command line does not feel intuitive, but it comes with practice.

Git is software for version control management.  Everytime we start a new project we will need to write new code for that project. What if as we worked we could save our original verions along with the new code and show changes we have made, but not only our changes, everyone who is working on the project and contributing to the code! It lets us see a project and all of its changes as we go.  We can see how long problems exist, what different types of solutions others can bring to the project, along with allowing multiple people to work on the same code without making multiple changes to the original work. This seems essential for working on a team while in different locations so multiple ideas and solutions can be brought to the table and the best final result is achieved. 

At first I struggled with the concept of cloning a repository to my computer.  I did not understand why I wouldnt just access and save the code on github and work on it through an integrated online text editor or ide.  This question helped me to understand the difference between Git and Github.  Using Git to work on our code and not having to commit until we have the code we want to make public, also allowing us to work remotely without a connection to github.  It also led me to do a little bit of research on Subversion/CVS and to see the benefits that Git offers in terms of having multiple working directories, allowing developers to work in different areas and files of a project, but also look at the changes that were made and bugs that were fixed through time to see the evolution of the project.  I'm rambling, so I will stop for now.  I still need to gain more confidence using the command line.
