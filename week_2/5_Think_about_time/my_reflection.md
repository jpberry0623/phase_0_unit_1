# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
* 
1)  My biggest challenge will be work/study balance.  I am still working full time and have already noticed that it is hard to balance the two as my job can require nights/weekends and being available whenever needed.  It is hard to carve out specific blocks of time to totally devote to coding and learning, but that is exactly what I think I will need to do in order to be successful in phase 0.

2) I need to set specific times to focus on my phase 0 material.  This will usually be at night between 5-11pm.  I also have to set clearly defined goals for when I want to accomplish each section of a weeks exercises while also giving myself time to relax and unwind a bit.  My goal for this week is to be done my sections by Saturday and leave Sunday for review.  This will help me know where I need to go back and allocate more time for better comprehension.

3)I really enjoyed the video in the FOGG method about starting new, small habits to change behavior.  I also need to realize when I am motivated and when I need to meditate and relax.  I find that if I try to force productivity in an unmotivated state, the results are poor as well my understanding of the material.

4)Overall plan is to section out specific times to work on the material.  Set clearly defined goals of when I want to accomplish each section(breaking into manageable chunks), and giving myself time at the end of the week to review material that I need more time with and reflect on the weeks learning.

Thanks!  P.S.- anyone who can pair this weekend â€”let me know.
