# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.



I though that the sematic web standards employed in HTML5 make sense.  I can imagine that it is a pain to change code on a site when you have no idea what the previous developer named all of their divs and classes--It would make for a long time scrolling through code and going back and forth between html and css files.  THe semantic layout gives some clarity to what every element on the page should be called so their is a sense of understanding amongst all coders who look and change the site.  It makes sense, but was tough to change gears just when I felt like I was getting the old tags in these languages down, lol. I encorporated the header, nav, article, and footer tags into my code.  I;m still a little fuzzy on the difference between section and article.  I guess article is for text and section can be for anything?

Reset.css also made sense to me.  Having a standard set of css rules at the top of your page so that things render properly across different browsers is a great idea.  Especially now that much of what is done on the web is done through mobile devices and tablets.   When I applied the reset css to my html file it brough my header closer to the browser window and further to the left.  I then put my own css underneath it.

I have noticed different browsers can display my page in unique ways.  I enjoy using chrome, but also will use safari from time to time. I watched a couple of videos on youtube to better understand the topics, but nothing was that great.  I still do not fully understand @font-face and need to do some more work with that.
