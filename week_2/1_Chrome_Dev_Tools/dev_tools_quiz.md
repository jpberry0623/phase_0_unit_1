##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
  * Javascript Debugging
  * Performance Optimization 

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?


I will be brief in my answers as this weeks is busy for me at work and I have limited time to devote to my exercises.

link to codeschool dashboard: http://minus.com/i/oMnfhpmFwJGv -  I think my score might reflect lower than it should.  I had to skip through a few of the challenges because although it seemd I was changing the correct lines of code, it would not let me pass.  Just a quick disclaimer, haha.

Realtime editing of the Html is done through the "elements" tab while CSS can be edited by accessing the right side of dev tools and clinking on the link that lists the area of your CSS file you wish to edit. you can debug you javascript through the console tab and feed the console javascript commands.  I would use the network tab for performance optimization and scroling through the color coded files to find out runtime stats and figures.  You can also disable your cache through settings to see how your page will load on an initial visit.

The quick key for Dev tools on MAC is command + Option + i.

We cannot adjust the color fo the text because the text is an image.  We would have to remove the image and add the actual headings/text and then style them as needed to change the color.

In ticketswizard.com the file "http://www.gstatic.com/domainads/tracking/caf.gif?ts=1398741227973&rid=5379322" is the largest image.  I used the network tab, refreshed the pages, and sorted the files by type.  Purple color coded files are images and this was listed first because it is the largest..

After running the Insight feature on www.ticketswizard.com, I think compiling the javascript folder would help optimize the site and that was the first thing I could think of.  Also looking at having the CSS pages load/linked prior to the JS files.
