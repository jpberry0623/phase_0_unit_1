        <h4>Pair Benefits</h4>
        <p id="section1">Pair programming has many benefits for us as students.  We can solve problems 
        together and have two sets of eyes working on the same code simultaneously.  It also creates a 
        bond between pair members that grows and builds cohesion throughout the cohort.  
        It allows each person in the pair to focus on different parts of the problem. i.e. one person
        focuses on syntax and another thinks more conceptually about the big picture. 
        </p>
        <h4>Driver vs. Navigator</h4>
        <p id="section2">The driver is the person who is writing the code.  They're focused on 
            implementing the code that the navigator is articulating. The navigator is focused on the 
            larger picture and not as concerned with the actual code. i.e the navigator would say they wanted
            to see a border on an element,  the driver would decide the border specifications and code
            syntax.
        </p>
        <h4>GPS Takeways</h4>
        <p id="section3">Its okay to consult stackoverflow to solve problems during the session, this
            is not an exam!  Our group bounced off one another and were less strict about the driver/
            navigator roles. Tanner felt very comfortable having John tell him where to position elements
            so he could focus on code and syntax.  John thought navigating was great because he could
            concentrate on looking at the layout, comparing the wireframe, and evaluating the code without
            having to constantly refresh a screen and go back an forth between browser and sublime.
