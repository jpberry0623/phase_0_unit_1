// This is a Solo Challenge. 

// There is a section below where you will write your code.
// Do not alter this object here.


var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
/* Pseudocode Section - write pseudocode for each challenge below.
1. Define a variable adam and use object literal notation to assign this variable 
   the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties.

2. Give adam a name property with the value "Adam".

3. Add a spouse property to terah and assign it the value of adam.

4. Change the value of the terah weight property to 125.

5. Remove the eyeColor property from terah.

6. Add a spouse property to adam and assign it the value of terah.

7. Add a children property to terah and and use object literal notation to assign 
   this variable the value of a JavaScript Object object with no properties

8. Add a carson property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
  the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carson".

9. Add a carter property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
   the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Carter".

10. Add a colton property to the value of the terah children property and assign it 
    the value of an object with the property name with a value of "Colton".

11. Add a children property to adam and assign it the value of terah children.

// This solo challenge really helped me get a better understanding of onject literals and adding new 
// properties to exisiting objects.  I struggled with the idea of not being able to just add adam as an property
// value of terah.  This challenge also made me explore the idea of inheritiance--if I wanted adam to inherit all of 
//  terahs properties, which led me to find more out about th prototype method for adding functions to constructors. 
//  As I was writing the code I felt that there was an DRYer way of writing the code, but after several attempts I 
//  could no find the correct syntax to make all of the properties remain within the object literal format rather 
// l;isting the new properties outside of the original variable object.  TYhe challenge really made me think about some
// new topics like inheritance, but I must search for a firmer understanding of how objects can interact with one another
// within other variables and functions.
