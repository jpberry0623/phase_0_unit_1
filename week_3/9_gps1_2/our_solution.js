//  Your Reflection:

ELz and I had a good pairing session.  We struggled with this challenge as we were both new to javascript and had not had
enough time to go trough the material to understand object oriented javascript which led us to spend most of hour session 
attempting to make our function pass.  We were not able to come up with right solution, but I felt we asked a lot of good 
questions of one another to describe what we were thinking and what concepts we were were stuck on.  Elz was the driver
for the first half of the session and I drove for a shorter time at the end.  We went back and forth sharing ideas
We were close to gaining a solution to how we should pass the information to our function, but all parties agreed we 
needed more time op look over javascript concepts.  Even though we struggled it was very helpful going through the challenge 
with Elz and recognizing similar areas we could bounce code solutions off one another to test. I used google and W3 schools
as references during the challenge, but was unable to solve our problem in the short time we had.  We have agreed to
put the code on ice so to speak and come back to it tomorrow night after further learning to tackle the challenge again.
I enjoyed trying to solve code, but fear that javascript will not come as easily as HTML and CSS.
